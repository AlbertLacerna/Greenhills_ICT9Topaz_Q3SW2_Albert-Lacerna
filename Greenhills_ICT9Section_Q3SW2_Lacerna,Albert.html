Steven Levitan</td>
			<td>I would say that this is one big family with the twist being each group of these families have two modern marriages with the gay couple and old and young couple with the traditional family. What makes this great this show accepts unique families and shows us the everyday lives of them bumping into one another in their daily lives. This show is worth watching seeing the love and comedy that they give to one another.</td>

		<td>One of my favortie marvel movies of all time is Doctor strange on how the humor and visual effects alone was enough to win me over. How we get to see a once successful surgeon is now a person who has no wealth of how he spent most of it fixing his broken hands. Goes to India where he thinks he can get help after he saw a miracle with one of the clients he turned down.</td>

<td>A shows with a wonderful balance of humor and romance this will surely make you fall in love will the characters that you will see in the shows. With you always wonders who will be Ted's the one as we follow him always faind the wrong one we the audience will have to wait for a long time just to find out as the father being Ted tells us the story of how he would get their finding the one. Though the ending was trash of how the last season which focused on a storyline quickly made it useless on the last two ep which was a mojor let down but was not a deal breaker.</td>

	<td>One of my first and favorite zombie movies and I am not sure why but it felt more then just a zombie more and I think it's because of well made chracters to why the movie was amazing. Because I love the relationship with the father just wanting to make her daughter gets to live and seeing that made movie very intense with the zombie jumping out of no where and you wanting at the least the little girl to survive at end. If you watched the ending it was worth all the random jump scares and death even if you hated it. </td>
